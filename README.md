# SAPPER-HOLS

### Yet another go at creating an app to track holidays booked and accrued

Using (this time):

- Svelte & Sapper
- Postgres to store the data
- Strapi CMS as the backend API - see [here](https://github.com/mrboot/strapi-hols "STRAPI-HOLS") for that repo.

Learning as I go so expect mistakes and _\*cough\*_ not industry standard coding standards I would imagine!
